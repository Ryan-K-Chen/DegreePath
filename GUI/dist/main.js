How do users behave in different security contexts, and why do they behave in those (often insecure) ways? Gaining this understanding is vital for driving improvements in real-world security. This seminar-style course will cover both classic and recent empirical security studies across a wide range of security topics, including Internet security, underground ecosystems, usable security, and online privacy. You will analyze, critique, and discuss these works. Beyond broadening your knowledge of real-world computer security, you will gain a deeper understanding of sound and rigorous measurement methodologies for applying to your own
