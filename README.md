# DegreePath
A webpage that allows Georgia Tech students to help plan their BS/MS degree courses from semester to semester. Drag and drop courses into each semester and DegreePath will give a warning for every unsatisfied prerequisite.

Currently offered courses are automatically obtained through BeautifulSoup webscraping by running gatechscrape.py. This will create a courses_dictionary.json to be imported into JavaScript. The webpage code is located in the GUI folder.
