        "Description": "Empirical security research seeks to understand how computer security concerns manifest in practice. For example, what strategies and techniques do attackers actually use, and how do they profit from their actions? How do users behave in different security contexts, and why do they behave in those (often insecure) ways? Gaining this understanding is vital for driving improvements in real-world security. This seminar-style course will cover both classic and recent empirical security studies across a wide range of security topics, including Internet security, underground ecosystems, usable security, and online privacy. You will analyze, critique, and discuss these works. Beyond broadening your knowledge of real-world computer security, you will gain a deeper understanding of sound and rigorous measurement methodologies for applying to your own work.",
